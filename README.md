# SFML-Space-Shooter
A 2D retro space shooter arcade game written in c++ using SFML library.

This project is for my personal development and first attempt at learning game development basics. Feel free to use or develop this application.

Development Setup
=================

My development environment is VS2017 on Windows 10. Code compiles with MSVC++ compiler. All SFML and glew dependencies are shipped in the source code.

Notes
=====

Code mostly uses C++ 14 STD libraries. I tried to avoid using platform specific code for the "core" parts of the game. If you want to
compile this on another system you should be able to do it simply by fixing compiler / linker errors depending on your platform.
